Building the client:
1. Receive a message and the server PID from the command line
2. Take that message and convert its char to its binary representation and send each letter to server in order.
2.1. Create an int mask = 0b10000000
2.2. using the mask compare the char and mask using the & operator which compares both bits and if there is a place where both bits are 1 it return 1 else it returns 0
2.3 Send the a signal depending on the result, if 1 SIGUSR1 else if 0 SIGUSR2 using the kill function
2.4 shift the bits in mask and assign 1 to the new bit location >>= 1
2.5 Wait for a signal back to verify that the letter was received from the server
2.5 After all letters have been sent then send a NULL 
Building the server:
1 When starting the server use ft_printf to display the servers PID on the terminal.
2. Create and infinite loop that is going to be receiving the signals
2.1 Make if condition that use sigaction(signal, act, NULL) and depending on the signal add a 0 or a 1 to an int.
2.2 Convert binary to the the char it represents and send it to ft_strjoin as src with the final string array as the destination (Repeat until NULL is sent).
2.2.1 In order to do this I need to create a char and initialize it with 0
2.2.2 Then I need to in a loop if i reiceive either a SIGUSR1 or a SIGUSR2 signal bit shift to the left and if the signal is SIGUSR2(That would correspond to a 1) use the | 1 operator to the bit.
2.2.3 use ft_strjoin to concatenate the char to the string
2.3 print the string to the terminal.
